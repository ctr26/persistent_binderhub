      We build and launch your <a href="https://notebooks.gesis.org/gallery/">binder-ready</a> repository so that you can interact with it just like on <a href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/known-deployments.html">any other</a> Binder deployment.
      Once a repository has been launched it will be added to the list of your projects.

      Your projects have a persistent $HOME directory whose contents are mirrored at /projects. Use the buttons in the table to launch, stop or delete an existing project.
      The <a href="https://github.com/gesiscss/data_science_image">data science</a>  image can be your place to begin. To update a project-image use the Binder form and for files use git.
      You can launch one project at a time and have up to 5 projects in total.
